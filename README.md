# Color Space Transformation Network
This is a color space network module that can plug into a neural network. 
It is a network layer that adjusts its configuration after training on a colored image dataset. Its output is a 3x3 transformation that is applied to the original 3-channeled images to help increase network's overall classification accuracy. 

More about the architecture can be found on the following short paper:
